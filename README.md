# Finesse

Working repo for Instagram Data Project @ Finesse

### Work flow:

1. Click on the green code button in the repo page and download the repo using

```bash
git clone https://github.com/franknb/finesse.git
```

2. **Presentation.pdf** is the presentation/document file containing some explanation and future planning for the project.

3. **requirements.txt** contains all the essential python packages needed for this project. Install by following codes

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Open up jupyter notebook and run **finesse_frankxu.ipynb**, which is the main file of this project. Make sure the **data/** folder, **post.pkl** and **utility.py** are in the same directory of the notebook file. Skip chunk 3 to save time and read directly from post.pkl in chunk 4.
